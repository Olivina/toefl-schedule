# 口语第二轮

[TOC]

## Fluency

句子和句子之间，连接词的位置可以有适当停顿。【连接词除了and uh和but uh 还能有什么？】

绝对不能叠字重复！！要停顿也是断开！！

叠字重复例如

> I agree with, ah, disagree with the statement ...

## Pronounciation

关键在于重音准确

对着siri念一段文章，看看能不能识别出来。如果识别不出来，就需要发音练习了。

## Vocabulary

用词准确。

口语首先需要大量输入后期才能输出。还是需要听口语录音。

2. T的连接词：because/that's because I think, xxx
3. E: you know/ I mean xxx

延伸的问题：要不要很多enemies/要不要树敌？

1. make enemies can motivate me // make me work harder. 因为有竞争者，so I work hard everyday, 
2. 不要树敌，not good for my future development. If I unfortunately meet troubles, these enemies will obstruct me. 所以应当多交朋友 so that I can gain help whenever I fall in trouble.然后是比赛段子。
