## Fluency

句子和句子之间，连接词的位置可以有适当停顿。【连接词除了and uh和but uh 还能有什么？】

切入点：

1. 通过**努力得到回报**

To our surprise, he even won the first prize, which really shocked me and I got to know the significance of intelligence.

延伸的问题：要不要很多enemies/要不要树敌？

1. make enemies can motivate me // make me work harder. 因为有竞争者，so I work hard everyday, 
2. 不要树敌，not good for my future development. If I unfortunately meet troubles, these enemies will obstruct me. 所以应当多交朋友 so that I can gain help whenever I fall in trouble.然后是比赛段子。

### Memory

> ## 题
>

>
> xxxx for a singing competition. This experience is really exciting and means a lot to me. So I always keep them with me.

## 环保段子

这个段子有两个版本

>   Well I think one way to reduce air pollution is planting trees because trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through a process known as photosynthesis. Also , trees can absorb other poisonous gases like SO2 NO and pm10, pm2.5, so the air will be much cleaner.
>
>   1.  But if not, there **<u>will be</u>** more and more carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere. So people might have to wear special masks to protect themselves and some people might get sick like getting lung cancer and something like that. Even more, some people might even die because of this.
>   2.  Besides, I think people should choose to take public **<u>tranportation</u>** like subway or bus **<u>because in this way</u>** the number of private cars will reduce, **<u>and so</u>** there will be less carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen monoxide in the atmosphere, **<u>so</u>** the air quality will improve.

一切和环保相关的都可以挂这个段子

### Community work

>
>   M: planting trees
>
>   T: Good for health
>
>   E: trees can purify the air, absorbing poisonous gases like SO2, NO, pm10 and stuff like that. Trees can absorb CO2 and release O2 through photosynthesis. 
>
>   C: otherwise, there will be more and more poisonous gases in the atmospher, which could cause damage to people's health, for example, people might have to wear special masks to protect themselves, some people might get sick, like lung cancer.

community work or voluntary work，都可以种树

### Change

谈在什么方面发生了什么变化，可以靠一下。这个话题还有一个是可以谈教育。

### Public Transportation

>   Do you agree/disagree with the opinion that bikes will be replaced by other means of transport?
>
>   M: Disagree with the statement that bikes will be replaced one day by other means of transport.
>
>   T: Because riding bikes is good for environment. 
>
>   E: Since bike is one of the most environmental friendly transpotation, if everybody ride a bike to school or workplace, they will not cause air pollution and the environment will be protected.
>
>   C: On the contrary, if bikes are replaced, then people will have to drive cars to school and work, pouring a lot of poisonous gases into the air, and that causes the air pollution.
>
>   A: Besides, riding bikes is good for health, since in riding bikes, people get more exercises, which is especially necessary for modern people who is busy working everyday.

Bikes将有一天被取代，你是否同意？

不同意啊，Bikes is one of the most ==environmental friendly transportation==, since if everybody ride to school, they will not cause air pollution --> protect the envrionment.

If not, driving cars and whatever,  ==这里怎么接？==环保段子

riding bikes还有一个好处是good for health, encourage people to do more exercises, since 要死了 had no time to go to the gym, but in riding bikes, they can get some exercises

### Learn from ancestors / the past

过去的错误中吸取教训同理，将来不会再make the same mistake两句套话也需要提及。后面就可以举环保段子：

My local community didin't pay attention to environment protection when devevloping economy, 5 years ago, like cut down a lot of trees, and built a lot of factories which polluted the air, so xxxx. Now the government are doing things to try to protect the envrionment like planting trees, 套段子。

#### 17年3月11

>   If there is only one green land left, the government should build houses, 要不要建？不建就成环保题了or keep it?
>
>   M: Well, if there is <u>only one</u> green land left in our city, I think the government should not build <u>houses</u> on it.
>
>   T: Because it's good for public health.
>
>   <u>saving</u> the green land and protecting the environment is more urgent.
>
>   E: I mean, once my local community didn't <u>pay attention</u> to environment protection when developing economy 5 years ago, they cut down a lot of trees, built a lot of houses and factories and stuff like that. The consequence was, they damaged the environment, and a lot of people got sick, even got lung cancer because of this.
>
>   A: After that, I think everybody should learn a lesson from the past so they will not make the same mistake in the future. This time I think the government should not build houses on it because saving the environment and improving the public health is more urgent.

#### 18年3月10:

Local government wants to build new factories in the city, which could help to create more job opportunities but pollute the environment. Do you think government should build it or not?显然不建，因为会polluted the environment, which is more urgent than creating job opportunities. Because 一旦污染会怎样怎样，先回答后果。

#### 18.12.8T1/17.7.10.T2

Some supermarket proposes a policy which people have to bring reusable bags when go shopping or else they have to pay some money to buy plastic bags. Talk about the A/D about this policy.

题干问A/D，回答的时候都要提及。A一般就是convenient，sometimes people forget to bring their own bags, if xxx then they can buy the stuff they want and use plastic bags to bring them home.

好坏的回答时间理论上是1:1，实际上一个多一点一个少一点都没关系，关键是两者都cover。

D: bad for environment, cause pollution like air pollution and soil pollution, which can put people's health at risk. 

>   Well, for one thing, the advantage of using a plastic bag is convenient, I mean, sometimes people may forget to bring their own reusable bags, if the supermarkets can provide them with plastic bags, they can buy whatever they want in the supermarket and use the plastic bags to bring them home.
>
>   On the other hand, the disadvantage of using a plastic bag is that it's bad for the environment. Since it can cause pollution like air pollution, if you burn it on the air; and soil pollution, if you bury it into the soil, both of them can put people's health at rist.

还有一道题和环保有一点点关系。

#### 国家有严重的traffic problem如何解决？



traffic jam/problem --> encourage people to ride bikes / walk instead of driving cars, since in this way we can reduce the number of private cars, the problem can be taken care of / relieved. 

还可以用一个点：the government could start a ride-sharing program, where people who live in the same area can form groups, with each group drive to campus or work places in just one car.后面信息不变, ==in this way, there will be fewer private cars so this problem can be taking care of / relieved / the number of private cars will reduce==.

这里关键是要加一个for example

>   Well, I think one way to deal with the serious problem of traffic jam is that our government can start a ride-sharing program, where people who live in the same area can form groups, with each group drive to campus or work places in just one car.
>
>   For example, if my classmate and I live in the same district, then we can form group, one person become the driver in turn while other people become the passengers and just take a ride.
>
>   In this way, I think the number of private cars on road will reduce and the traffic jam problem will relieve.

## 论文三件套

>   Start writing papers right away or wait until deadline
>
>   ### 段子
>
>   Well, I prefer to start writing all my papers right away because this is good for me. 
>
>   I mean, in this way, I could have more time to prepare like going to the library to read some books or getting online to collect some data or ask the professors when I have some problems. So I am able to finish them on time. On the contrary, if I wait until the last minute, I might not be able to get fully prepared because of the limited time, which could result in a hasty work and hurt my grades.

### deadline写

图书馆路线实际上是说deadline。

M: I prefer to wait until deadline to start my working.

T: Because deadline is the primary productive force.

E: I mean, because of the limited time, I can **work more efficiently** and **more focus** on my task, for example, I will go to the library and find a quiet place to fully concentrate on my work. I am more prone to do a good job in this way. 

C: On the contrary, if I start working very early, due to the plenty of time, I might be working casually and easily get distracted by other things, like movies, exihibitions, music concerts and stuff like that, which usually distract me and even make me forget about the task/ assignment, and this could result in a late submission.

### Life(make mistakes; learn from the past)

### Assignment Related



#### paper VS presentation/ take tests; long essays/short ones

>   M: paperwork
>
>   T: good for my grade
>
>   E: If I can do the paperwork, then I can get myself fully prepared, like xxxx
>
>   C: but if I choose to do a presentation, I might get nervous in front of a large crowd, in this situation I might forget everything that I prepared, resulting in a bad performance and it will hurt my grades.

take tests同理，紧张忘掉everything。

老师应该让学生做一些activities，group work/presentation来完成assignment，还是written form的assignment？(in order for them to learn course material well)

选written form，因为这个过程中会干什么（查东西，找老师讨论，论文三件套）, which could communicate a lot with professors, gain a better understanding of the topic.

>   M: paperwork instead of take tests
>
>   T: good for my academic learning
>
>   E: I mean, xxxx
>
>   C: but if I take tests, I might do cramming the night before,临时抱佛脚, memorize a lot of things in a short period but after that I will forget them all, which is not good for my academic learning.

一篇长论文/很多短论文？

长论文：可以准备这准备那

写很多小的：some might fail to finish because of the limited time

#### 17.2一道题

the students are asked to write a final project about the famous historical city which you are located in, which one will you choose to finish your project?完成论文的方式有三个：

1.  make videos about the buildings 
2.  interview older people or
3.  do research and write **papers**.

>   那当然选paper，because it's easy for me, 你只需要xxxxx段子过来。
>
>   I mean, in this process, I can get myself fully prepared.
>
>   But on the contrary, make videos or interview are pretty hard for me, because for one thing, I'm not good at using camera and stuff to make videos and also I'm not good at talking with other people.

论文特好写，其他的都说自己不行就行了。

17.2的另一道题

Some people are graded by their performance when they're participating in group discussions in a class while others thinks that they're graded only by written paperwork, which do you prefer and why?

有些学生认为课堂参与互动都应该计入打分，有些学生就认为written work就可以了。我们当然选论文啊，因为可以reflect their academic performance, that's because in writing a paper, students need to xxxxxx. Therefore, if they can get a high grade, they surely have a better academic performance.

On the other hand, about class performance, some students might be too shy to perform themselves, which is unfair to them.

18.4.15

some professors ask students to take in-class exams while other professors like to ask their students to take the test at home and hand in the test paper in the next day. What are the advantages and disadvantages of taking home exams?

特点：可以带回家/带回宿舍，论文方向

One of the advantages for students to take the test home is good for students' academic learning.

I mean, in this way, they are able to 论文三件套, 

But if they take in-class exam, they might get very nervous and forget everything they prepared, which may result in a failure in the exam.

### 生活类



是否要learn from the past?当然要啊，because this is good, since people are able to learn a lesson from the past, so they will not make the same mistake in the future.

for example, 写论文的时候，Once I wait until the last minute did I start writing my paper. After that, I 很快完成。

#### 18.3.11 parent should allow their kids to make mistakes

<!--ptr_recording-->

同理，应该啊，only by allowing kids to make mistake will kids really know about the mistake by themselves and thus correct the mistake themselves, so that they will not make the same mistake in the future. 什么时候我时间紧迫论文完不成，我妈妈也没有管我，didn't stop me, and I failed the course. I came to realize the fault so since then I start writing paper right away

Make mistake也可以用图书馆大声喧哗的段子。都属于家长allow犯错再告诉他。

## 打工段子

Share a house with other ppl or rent an apartment alone

单人多人？单人-->自己独住对学习好，图书馆段子，focus on，但是多人可能会开party唱歌。

单人-->要死了，回家可以安静的睡个觉，多人不利于休息。多人也可以利于要死了-->回到家之后开party可以放松，但是一个人会lonely。

和别人在一起更加容易解决问题：事业线/看狗之类的。

>   Well, I prefer to share a house with other people because it's gonna save me a lot of money. You konw, I'm just a first year student in college and I don't have much money. I have to do some part time jobs to earn some money to cover my tuition and stuff【这里似乎可以补充一个花钱三件套】. Therefore, If I could share a house with other people, I could split the rent with them which will be good. But if I rent an apartment alone, I'd have to [cover all the apartment rent myself, which means I have to] spend more time doint part time jobs to make more money which I think will make me feel tired and definitely will affect my study as well.

和金钱相关的everything都可以用。

#### electronic devices: buy them right away or wait for some time?

当然要等啊，没有钱，我是学生。因此我要是等一下的话，price will drop。可是如果马上买，it will be very expensive, for example, brand new iphone will cost me 700 dollars or more, so I'd have to spend more time doing part time jobs.

#### fix myself or send it to the repair shop

自己修省钱，fix it by myself would cost me nothing. repair shop非常规，it costs hundreds of dollars to fix one small furniture, in order to afford which I had have to do extra part-time jobs, which xxxx

#### scholarship 给谁

1.  students who live poor
2.  students who have better academic performances

显然要给穷一点的学生, because it's good for their study.

I mean, they do not have enough money to afford their tuition fees and daily use, so they have to do part-time jobs to cover their expenses, which makes them tired everyday and have hardly had time to study, and that affect their academic performances. If they can acquire that money, then they be able to spend less time taking part time jobs, and will be able to spend more time on their studies, which is good for them.

#### Audio books or paper books

which is cheaper?

in the long terms, paperbooks is cheaper. Because audio books could break in the future, like change the battery, fix the screen, update its system and stuff like that, which is also an enormous expense in the future. And I'm only a student with no income, these kinds of expense will add to my economic burden. 

#### famous university with higher tuition or less famous one with scholarship?

谈钱就去scholarship, because it can save money. I mean I'm a student who have no income, and xxxx. If I can obtain the scholarship, then I am able to spend more time on study. On the contrary, if I have to pay higher tuition, then I have to spend more time doing part-time jobs, 

#### Supermarket plastic policy

好处也可以说save money, bring reusable bags. But if I need to pay plastic bags each time, then in the long run it will cost a lot of money.

你有一个朋友，到你们国家来学习担心钱，你建议他做什么/你是否建议他打工。你也可以不建议他打工，因为会影响学习，占用很多时间，让他很累等等。打工可以赚钱但是也很累，累就会影响学习占用时间。钱相关的都可以套。

## 足球段子

kids who take part in team sports have better social abilities.

>   Well, I agree with the statement that kids who play team sports can actually have better social skills.
