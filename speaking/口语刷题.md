## t1【电子化？】

Some people think that materials printed on paper, such as books and newspapers, will one day be replaced by electronic versions of those materials. Others believe that printed materials will always be popular. Which point of view do you agree, and why?

Ans:

M: I believe all traditional printed materials will eventually be replaced by their electronic versions. 

T: Because it's very convenient to read and spread.

E: I mean, electronic versions of these materials allow us to read news and information by one click. 

A: for example, everyday when I take bus to school, I can open news apps in my mobile phone and start reading.

C: but the traditional printed newspaper, on the contrary, is hard to open and impossible to read in bus. I believe everybody has this kind of situation, which is very inconvenient.

so that's the reason why I believe traditional versions of these materials will eventually be replaced.
