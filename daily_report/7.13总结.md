7.13 总结

任务完成情况（今天只用了半天时间，所以任务完成约一半）

听力TPO一套，阅读TPO一套，今天所有TPO听力都读了两遍。

1. 阅读需要做两篇来恢复感觉，难度不大，但错误较多，26/30。阅读不存在文本不理解的情况，但是对提问方式常常不敏感。
2. 听力考虑跟读一次+自己读一次。art history那一篇处理的不好，photograph job那一篇处理的不好。21/30
3. 写作第一篇没写完。明天首先把今天的口语听力TPO处理完，然后处理新一篇4个TPO。
4. 输出型项目要求精力较好的时候完成。建议明天早上优先完成口语写作，然后剩下时间再处理听力阅读。
5. 报告有什么问题/需要增加什么内容/需要澄清哪些东西 请告诉我 我会从明天起在报告里增加。

以下是笔记。
