The regulation for handling and storing coal ash is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the reading passage, the author proposes three reasons why the regulation is unnecessary. The professor, however, claimed that the new regulation is absolutely necessary.

First, the writer says that the relevant regulations already exist, which force companies to use liner to store their coal ash components. As opposed to this idea, the professor states that these regulations only apply on new built power plants, and there are still many old power plants causing significant damages like contaminating underground water and soil.

Second, the writer suggests that strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discouraging the recycling of coal ash by making consumers concerned that they are dangerous. The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion by examining the fact that mercury is handled and processed under very strict rules but it only raise limited concerns about its savety, and thus concludes that the strict rules for handling not necessarily lead to a discourage for its use.

Third, the writer argues that strict new regulations would increase the costs for power companies. The professor contends that it'll only increase 1% of the public's house electrical bill, which is not a big deal.
