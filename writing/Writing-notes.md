> 没有给对方增加理由，只需要提出观点就行

### 自己观点

>
> **due to** 
>
> * <u>due to the contributions to 果</u>，因为对xxx的好，95%的都用这个
> * <u>due to 因</u>，呼应接下来两个段落的<总论点

>
> <u>Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that</u> online learning, which requires students to attend classes on computers and televisions, is superior, <u>due to the contributions to</u> their academic performance and personal development.

## 中间段落

两段，每段5句话：

* 总论点（长句子，包含内容）
* 分论点1（非常简洁）
  * 解释1（长句，正面展开+反面对比）
* 分论点2（短句）
  * 解释2（长句，正面展开+反面对比）

### 总论点：看图说话

要求总论点要能很好的概述下面的分论点。

> **<u>What must be prioritized is that</u>** **taking distance-learning courses**, *instead of having courses in traditional classrooms*<u>而不是直接放在对比的对象之后</u>, **is beneficial to student's academic learning**, *by offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning*.

### 解释

理由说/方面说/理由方面说：网上有很多的搜索引擎，所以能够获得广泛的知识。根据字数来判断，如果只写一个不够字数的话，就合在一起写。

> **<u>To begin with</u>**, it's **online education** that provides students with the access to a large quantity of **expertise**. (分论点1) **<u>In detail</u>**, **on the internet**, students can acquire a wide range of **knowledge** in **history, art and science**, enlarging their **knowledge** base;分号断开的两句话联系比较紧密 **<u>in contrast</u>**, *such a large amount of knowledge* cannot be obtained when they are instructed by only one teacher *in concrete classrooms*.（解释1）
>
> 正面：学生在网上可以学到xxxx的知识
>
> 反面：这样的知识在传统课堂中是学不到的

### 分论点

在线教育 --> 兴趣

可以下手的点：对于xxx的兴趣

> **<u>Moreover</u>**, never can we ignore the significance of **distance education** to students' **interest** in learning. （分论点2）**<u>To explain it further</u>**, by receiving education on the internet, students will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, to do research and to write proposals; **<u>on the other hand</u>**, will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lecture in brick-and-motar classrooms?<!--xswl-->
>
> 正面：网上学习学生会觉得xxx这些事情更有意思：把interest下切了
>
> 反面：针对这个内容来说：这些任务学生是不会有兴趣的，在传统的课堂中总是讲述的话。

## 第二段同理

> **<u>What should be equally discussed is that</u>** **receiving distance education**, *rather than having traditional face-to-face courses*, **can promote students' personal development**, <u>by honing their interpersonal skills and cultivating their persistence</u>.（总论点）

> **To begin with**, it is well-acknowledged that educated on the internet, students can practice their communication skills.（分论点1）**<u>Specifically</u>**, only in online learning environment will students come across people from diverge backgrounds, such as classmates, instructors and school administrators, with whom they can practice their tactics of socializing; **<u>on the contrary</u>**, under no circumstances will they interact with such a variety of people if they are educated in traditional classroom settings.（解释1）

> **<u>Additionally</u>**, when having a distance education program, students will become more determined. **<u>To be more specific</u>**, **the more** distance-learning courses they take on the internet, **the more** distractions they will be exposed to, stimulating them to resist temptations and foster their persistence; **<u>however</u>**, it's impossible for them to encounter these lures in traditional classrooms.

中间段落不需要加例子。反面已经很全面了

## 结尾

> Academic performance, **<u>the foundation of students' future development</u>**, will be boosted when they receive online education. Personal development, **<u>essential contributors to students' future success</u>**, will be facilitated if they're educated on the internet. **<u>To conclude, only by</u>** having distance education, **<u>instead of</u>** being taught in classroom, **<u>can</u>** student reap numerous benefits.

1. 总结总论点1
2. 总结总论点2
3. 总结全文



## 破题

一般认为只有两类题：现象题/利弊题

### 利弊题

逻辑起点对逻辑终点有什么好处

Compare with people who live in cities, people who live in rural areas can take better care of families.

逻辑起点（二选一）：

1. 住在农村
2. 住在城市

逻辑终点：

* 照顾家人

对城市更熟悉。我们选择住在城市。逻辑链条：

住在城市 --> 更好照顾家人 by
1. more money
2. infrastructure


不需要推more money到caring family，题目的核心是big cities。接下来需要推big cities-->这两条

1. big cities --> more money
    1. how: 大城市为什么能赚钱？
        1. to：大城市的钱能做什么？（投资教育）
        1. to：用于医疗，对家庭好
    1. big cities --> better infrastructure
        1. 有哪些基础设施？超市/交通

给的小逻辑之间必须一致。必须同样是理由或者同样是方面。

#### 题

> If your teacher says something incorrect in a class, what will you do?
>
> 1) Interrupt your teacher right away.
>
> 2) keep silent
>
> 3) correct your teacher after cls.
>
> 选择（3），after cls -> good. 选择推中间环节方面。
>
> 1. afterclass --> good relationship --> (good)
>   1. reflects respect
>    2. more communication
> 2. aft cls --> good academic performance --> (good)
>    1. by help teacher locating error --> 
>    2. by help students learning more knowledge

#### 题

> [利弊题]The best way for the government to improve health care is cleaning the environment.
>
> 利弊题就去寻找谁推谁。这里就是cleaning the environment --> improving health care
>
> 一种写法是赞同。可以把health切开：
>
> 1. physical health 
>   1. air quality
>    2. food quality
> 2. mental health
>    1. less pressure
>    2. happiness
> 
> 其他方法更好：写在逻辑起点（把原来的逻辑起点扔了），但是因为题目给了clean environment，所以所有地方都需要对比：
>
> 1. health education --> health care
>   1. by advocating knowledge > environment 相反，改善环境不会给人带来更多的知识
>    2. by encouraging exercise like building playgrounds > environment 相反，改善环境并不能促进人们运动
> 2. medical care --> health care
>    1. hospital > environment ...
>    2. experts > environment ...

### 现象题

有两种写法：

1. 现象产生的原因【类似于理由说】

   例如学生现在尊重老师//学生现在不尊重老师 都是有原因的：思想活跃/有批判性思维，导致了现象。

2. 现象的具体体现【类似于方面说】

   学生现在确实不尊重老师：批评老师/不理睬老师。

#### 题

> Nowadays young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.
>
> 定题（二选一）：
>
> 1. 现在花更多时间
> 2. 现在花更少时间
>
> 花更少时间相对好写一点。我们就给原因。

>#### 第一种写法：现象产生的原因
>
>？？ --> now less time improving the world
>
>1. busy --> less time
>  1. 切逻辑终点:
>      1. busy --> no time to improving environment
>      2. busy --> no time to devote to education
>   2. 切逻辑起点：
>      1. busy study --> no time to improving the world
>      2. busy working --> no time to improving the world
>2. incapable
>   1. 切逻辑起点：
>      1. no money --> incapable of improving the world
>      2. no knowledge --> incapable of improving the world
>
>#### 第二种写法：现象的具体体现
>
>这次换一个定题：Nowadays younger people spend more time on improving the world than in the past
>
>做了哪些事情改善世界？
>
>1. improving the world
>
>   用现象说现象
>
>   1. improving the air quality
>  2. improving the water quality
>
>2. devoting to the technology
>
>   1. choose technology majors
>  2. willing to give suggestions

### 天使题、魔鬼题【偶遇】

#### 天使题

The **personal and work-related challenges** we face now are different from **those** our parents and grandparents faced when they were young.

现象题，神奇之处在于它题干里面已经包含了两个方面。

Children should **play and study** rather than learn how to do household chores.

People should relax with **hobbies and physical activities** that are different from what they do in work.

##### 题

The opinions of celebrities, such as **entertainers and athletes**, are more important to the young people than they are to the older people.
利弊题。我们可以选择对年轻人更重要。
逻辑链条：celebrities --> young people
1. 起点（题目已经切好了）
   1. entertainers
   2. athletes
2. 终点：
   1. important to students
      1. entertainer: teach students about fashions
      2. athletes: persistence
   2. important to young adults
      1. entertainer: teach how to get alone with friendship
      2. athletes: value exercises
   3. 其实也可以两个起点分别写对young people的好。就不用在终点切开。

#### 魔鬼题

题目包含从句，逻辑终点比较窄。写作的时候所有思路都要落在逻辑终点上，过程中要从头到尾体现出来。

Do you agree or disagree with the statement: To truely enjoy a vacation(holidy), people should leave their mobile phones at home.

In order to attract good students, many universities should spend a lot of money in social activities.

To improve health, which aspect will you change in life?

1. Kinds of food to eat
2. the amount of exercise
3. the amout of stress

这道题可以试着写the amount of exercise:

More exercise -->

1. physical health
   1. by strengthening muscle
   2. by alleviating eyestrain
2. mental health
   1. by help forgetting worries
   2. by prompting happiness
      1. chemical
      2. communication with friends

### 利弊/现象题的写法不同

#### 反面对比

题目的key words均匀分散在文章中，特别是**自己的选项要不断出现**

##### 如何找题目关键词？

**删除法**：删了之后对于句子影响很大，就是关键词。

> Compared with people who live in **cities**, people who live in **rural areas** can **take better care of families**.

> If your teacher says something **incorrect** in a class, what will you do?
>
> **Interrupt** your teacher **right away**
>
> **keep silent**
>
> **correct** your teacher **after cls**.

还有自己的关键选项一定要反复出现：cities / clean env / after cls

#### 如何对比？

AB题：认为A重要，对比B

ABC题：认为A重要，第一个理由段对比B，第二个理由段对比C

A题：

* 认为A重要，对比-A

* 认为BC重要，对比A

##### 例子

AB：大城市能更好照顾家庭，相反，农村没办法更好照顾

现在年轻人花时间更多改善世界：环境多科技多//相反，过去人们不关心这些事

ABC：课后改正老师不好//立刻打断没什么什么好处//保持沉默也没有什么什么好处

A：相反，如果政府**不**改善环境，就没有这些好处

### 其他特殊

现象题里面比较多。论证这个点存在与否。不能说due to the contributions to，而要说due to原因//including小点

Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that ...,
* due to xxxx原因
* including xxxx小点
  * disregarding teacher's opinion
  * disregarding knowledges that the teacher teaches

#### 例子

> Nowadays young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.
>
> 两种写法：
>
> 1. <u>Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that modern young people spend less time on improving the world, due to</u> less time and incapability.
>2. <u>Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that modern young people spend more time on improving the world,</u> including the field of environment and technology.

现象题的总结也不能说只有xxx才能xxx，而要写：

> <u>To conclude, only by considering those mentioned above can we draw the conclusion that</u> young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.

## 直播课01:相关

### 话题相关词

光有逻辑词不够，还必须要语言相关。

> 1)在所有的课程里面,最喜欢的是记单词,因为很多小游戏比如拼图、冒险岛、猫捉老鼠都能让我们感受到生活的多样性,而在英语学习中广泛阅读是很关键的。
>
> 2)在所有的课程里面,最喜欢的是英语课,课堂上老师会组织很多小游戏帮助我们记单词,我们还可以用英语表达自己的观点,英语课堂的娱乐性和自由度是在其他课堂上没有的。
>
> 前者虽然有连接词，但是词汇几乎毫无关联；后者的词汇之间都是有关联的：课程-->英语课-->记单词-->英语表达-->娱乐性自由度

相关度：homework -->paper/assignment/schoolwork/problem/exercise/report/project/presentation

**必须要出现话题相关词**，这样读者思维才是顺着的，才会感觉到文章清楚。

同义词和反义词都是可以的：

young people -->old

下义词：homework --> presentation

上义词：homework --> study/education

重复的过程其实就是词汇呼应。环环相扣的文章是好的文章。文章是句子构成的。如何写得一句咬着一句？

### 句子重心

单词排布顺序不同，句子想要传达的重心不一样。

> 1. Extracurricular activities are overwhelming especially **for high school students**.
>
> 2. High school students are overwhelmed by **extracurricular activities**.
>
> 3. Due to various extracurricular activities high school students are **overwhelmed**.
>
> 看起来重心应该是在句子后面。

重心在句子主干，更在句末。一般读者都是先看前面再看后面，读者会默认前面是熟悉的信息/旧信息；后面才是新信息。因为重心在句末，下一句应该根据上一句的句末来关联：AB BC CD DE的关联法。

> Due to various extracurricular activities, high school students are **overwhelmed**. **Busy with** student clubs and social events, students find it laborious to arrange their schedule effectively or distribute sufficient time to **academic learning**. **Their grades**, consequently, are seriously affected.

### 独立写作

3 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 16句话。不是每个段落都需要ABBC推过来。但是开头段3句要一句推着一句往下写。

> ## 上次作业
>
> > Nowadays it is important for people to have regular family meals together.
> > 现在很重要
> > 1.对于健康好 
> > 	a.身体健康，家里吃的食物干净 
> > 	b.精神健康，家里人能聊天，忘记烦恼 
> > 2.对于人际关系好 
> > 	a.互相交换信息，了解彼此工作生活情况 
> > 	b.互相帮助，提出解决问题的方法
>
> ### 第一段
>
> 可以分理出中性词：meals/diets
>
> > <u>**Diets**, the foundation of **life** / the objectives everyone strives for,</u>
>
> diets 和life就不相关，能不能换一个？**healthy lifestyle**
>
> > **Diets**, the foundation of healthy lifestyle, have been valued and even trigger a heated discussion over...
>
> over后面也要找一个能够和前面diets连上关系的词
>
> > **Diets**, the foundation of healthy lifestyle, have been valued and even trigger a heated discussion over whether **family meals** are still significant nowadays.
>
> 直接说有的人认为其他的观点会让读者觉得有点突然。所以建议用**插入语**，先连接上面的family meals，然后再提出别人的观点：
>
> > **Diets**, the foundation of healthy lifestyle, have been valued and even trigger a heated discussion over whether **family meals** are still significant nowadays. **Eating with family members,** in some people's views, should be valued.
>
> ### 插入语不是想用就用的！！
>
> 然后讲自己的观点的时候，如何相关呢？代词也是文章相关度的一个小指标。
>
> > Contrary to **these** people's view is my perspective that xxx
>
> these就可以连着上面的some people's views
>
> > **Diets**, the foundation of healthy lifestyle, have been valued and even trigger a heated discussion over whether **family meals** are still significant nowadays. **Eating with family members,** in **some people's views**, should be valued. Contrary to **these people**'s view is my perspective that it is important / crucial / vital to have meals with famil**ies**, <u>due to the contributions to</u> people's health and interpersonal relationship**s**.
>
> 最后的就是两个分论点（新信息）
>
> 可数名词不能单独存在，想要使用必须加s
>
> ### 第二段
>
> <!--<span style="color:#00FE;font-weight:bold;">Cyan Text</span>-->
>
> > What must be prioritized is that **(<u>family --> health</u>**) having meals with family members, instead of dining in restaurants, will contribute to people's health, both physically and mentally. (<u>**family --> physical health**</u>) To begin with, it is ==family== meals that ensure physical health for people. To be more specific, (**family --> ? --> <u>physical health</u>**) ==at home==, people can take in cleanly washed and newly prepared vegetables and meat, <u>which can guarantee people fully absorb nutrition</u>; on the other hand==,== 

>   这时候有两种方法可以接：
>
>   1.  such benefits will not be gained
>   2.  fresh **ingredients** and **well-balanced meals** will not be gained
>
>   哪种更相关？2更相关的原因不是因为具体，而是因为在词汇上有呼应，是话题相关词。26-27分在进行对比的时候就是指代，但是28分以上就是会把上面内容重复（不是一模一样，而要稍微改一下）
>
>   相关必然会重复，我们可以稍微变化一下语言形式。
>
>   >   What must be prioritized is that **(<u>family --> health</u>**) having meals with family members, instead of dining in restaurants, will contribute to people's health, both physically and mentally. (<u>**family --> physical health**</u>) To begin with, it is ==family== meals that ensure physical health for people. To be more specific, (**family --> ? --> <u>physical health</u>**) ==at home==, people can take in cleanly washed and newly prepared vegetables and meat, <u>which can guarantee people ==fully absorb nutrition==</u>; on the other hand, ==these fresh ingredients and well-balanced meals== will not be gained if people eat themselves outside. Moreover, (**family --> ? --> mental health**) by having meals with families, people will keep mental health.（概括性说一下就行，不用很复杂）(解释：**family -->forget about pressure --> mental health**) In detail, during the process of dining with families, members will discuss over  <u>pleasant memories</u>, including childhood stories, parent's wedding and family trips, **distracting** them from pressure; on the contrary, <u>such delightful moments in the past</u> will not be recalled by a person, who has a meal outside. 
>
>   对比的时候不要提到其他的好处，例如不要说在外面会想家，容易显得不相关。
