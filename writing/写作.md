## 模版：开头段

### 现象引入

> **<u>N, 同位语, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over 题目改写</u>**

> 没有给对方增加理由，只需要提出观点就行

### 自己观点

>
> **due to** 
>
> * <u>due to the contributions to 果</u>，因为对xxx的好，95%的都用这个

>
> <u>Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that</u> online learning, which requires students to attend classes on computers and televisions, is superior, <u>due to the contributions to</u> their academic performance and personal development.

## 中间段落

5句话：

* 总论点（长句子，包含内容）
* 分论点1（非常简洁）
  * 解释1（长句，正面展开+反面对比）
* 分论点2（短句）
  * 解释2（长句，正面展开+反面对比）

### 总论点：看图说话

要求总论点要能很好的概述下面的分论点。

> **<u>What must be prioritized is that</u>** **taking distance-learning courses**, *instead of having courses in traditional classrooms*<u>而不是直接放在对比的对象之后</u>, **is beneficial to student's academic learning**, *by offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning*.

### 解释

理由说/方面说/理由方面说：网上有很多的搜索引擎，所以能够获得广泛的知识。根据字数来判断，如果只写一个不够字数的话，就合在一起写。

> **<u>To begin with</u>**, it's **online education** that provides students with the access to a large quantity of **expertise**. (分论点1) **<u>In detail</u>**, **on the internet**, students can acquire a wide range of **knowledge** in **history, art and science**, enlarging their **knowledge** base;分号断开的两句话联系比较紧密 **<u>in contrast</u>**, *such a large amount of knowledge* cannot be obtained when they are instructed by only one teacher *in concrete classrooms*.（解释1）
>
> 正面：学生在网上可以学到xxxx的知识
>
> 反面：这样的知识在传统课堂中是学不到的

## 分论点

在线教育 --> 兴趣

可以下手的点：对于xxx的兴趣

> **<u>Moreover</u>**, never can we ignore the significance of **distance education** to students' **interest** in learning. （分论点2）**<u>To explain it further</u>**, by receiving education on the internet, students will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, to do research and to write proposals; **<u>on the other hand</u>**, will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lecture in brick-and-motar classrooms?<!--xswl-->
>
> 正面：网上学习学生会觉得xxx这些事情更有意思：把interest下切了
>
> 反面：针对这个内容来说：这些任务学生是不会有兴趣的，在传统的课堂中总是讲述的话。

## 第二段同理

> **<u>What should be equally discussed is that</u>** **receiving distance education**, *rather than having traditional face-to-face courses*, **can promote students' personal development**, <u>by honing their interpersonal skills and cultivating their persistence</u>.（总论点）

> **To begin with**, it is well-acknowledged that educated on the internet, students can practice their communication skills.（分论点1）**<u>Specifically</u>**, only in online learning environment will students come across people from diverge backgrounds, such as classmates, instructors and school administrators, with whom they can practice their tactics of socializing; **<u>on the contrary</u>**, under no circumstances will they interact with such a variety of people if they are educated in traditional classroom settings.（解释1）

> **<u>Additionally</u>**, when having a distance education program, students will become more determined.**<u>To be more specific</u>**, **the more** distance-learning courses they take on the internet, **the more** distractions they will be exposed to, stimulating them to resist temptations and foster their persistence; **<u>however</u>**, it's impossible for them to encounter these lures in traditional classrooms.

中间段落不需要加例子。反面已经很全面了

## 结尾

> Academic performance, **<u>the foundation of students' future development</u>**, will be boosted when they receive online education. Personal development, **<u>essential contributors to students' future success</u>**, will be facilitated if they're educated on the internet. **<u>To conclude, only by</u>** having distance education, **<u>instead of</u>** being taught in classroom, **<u>can</u>** student reap numerous benefits.

1. 总结总论点1
2. 总结总论点2
3. 总结全文



## 破题

一般认为只有两类题：现象题/利弊题

### 利弊题

逻辑起点对逻辑终点有什么好处

Compare with people who live in cities, people who live in rural areas can take better care of families.

逻辑起点（二选一）：

1. 住在农村
2. 住在城市

逻辑终点：

* 照顾家人

对城市更熟悉。我们选择住在城市。逻辑链条：

住在城市 --> 更好照顾家人 by
1. more money
2. infrastructure


不需要推more money到caring family，题目的核心是big cities。接下来需要推big cities-->这两条

1. big cities --> more money
    1. how: 大城市为什么能赚钱？
        1. to：大城市的钱能做什么？（投资教育）
        1. to：用于医疗，对家庭好
    1. big cities --> better infrastructure
        1. 有哪些基础设施？超市/交通

给的小逻辑之间必须一致。必须同样是理由或者同样是方面。

#### 题

> If your teacher says something incorrect in a class, what will you do?
>
> 1) Interrupt your teacher right away.
>
> 2) keep silent
>
> 3) correct your teacher after cls.
>
> 选择（3），after cls -> good. 选择推中间环节方面。
>
> 1. afterclass --> good relationship --> (good)
>   1. reflects respect
>    2. more communication
> 2. aft cls --> good academic performance --> (good)
>    1. by help teacher locating error --> 
>    2. by help students learning more knowledge

#### 题

> [利弊题]The best way for the government to improve health care is cleaning the environment.
>
> 利弊题就去寻找谁推谁。这里就是cleaning the environment --> improving health care
>
> 一种写法是赞同。可以把health切开：
>
> 1. physical health 
>   1. air quality
>    2. food quality
> 2. mental health
>    1. less pressure
>    2. happiness
> 
> 其他方法更好：写在逻辑起点（把原来的逻辑起点扔了），但是因为题目给了clean environment，所以所有地方都需要对比：
>
> 1. health education --> health care
>   1. by advocating knowledge > environment 相反，改善环境不会给人带来更多的知识
>    2. by encouraging exercise like building playgrounds > environment 相反，改善环境并不能促进人们运动
> 2. medical care --> health care
>    1. hospital > environment ...
>    2. experts > environment ...

### 现象题

有两种写法：

1. 现象产生的原因【类似于理由说】

   例如学生现在尊重老师//学生现在不尊重老师 都是有原因的：思想活跃/有批判性思维，导致了现象。

2. 现象的具体体现【类似于方面说】

   学生现在确实不尊重老师：批评老师/不理睬老师。

#### 题

> Nowadays young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.
>
> 定题（二选一）：
>
> 1. 现在花更多时间
> 2. 现在花更少时间
>
> 花更少时间相对好写一点。我们就给原因。

>#### 第一种写法：现象产生的原因
>
>？？ --> now less time improving the world
>
>1. busy --> less time
>  1. 切逻辑终点:
>      1. busy --> no time to improving environment
>      2. busy --> no time to devote to education
>   2. 切逻辑起点：
>      1. busy study --> no time to improving the world
>      2. busy working --> no time to improving the world
>2. incapable
>   1. 切逻辑起点：
>      1. no money --> incapable of improving the world
>      2. no knowledge --> incapable of improving the world
>
>#### 第二种写法：现象的具体体现
>
>这次换一个定题：Nowadays younger people spend more time on improving the world than in the past
>
>做了哪些事情改善世界？
>
>1. improving the world
>
>   用现象说现象
>
>   1. improving the air quality
>  2. improving the water quality
>
>2. devoting to the technology
>
>   1. choose technology majors
>  2. willing to give suggestions

### 天使题、魔鬼题【偶遇】

#### 天使题

The **personal and work-related challenges** we face now are different from **those** our parents and grandparents faced when they were young.

现象题，神奇之处在于它题干里面已经包含了两个方面。

Children should **play and study** rather than learn how to do household chores.

People should relax with **hobbies and physical activities** that are different from what they do in work.

##### 题

The opinions of celebrities, such as **entertainers and athletes**, are more important to the young people than they are to the older people.
利弊题。我们可以选择对年轻人更重要。
逻辑链条：celebrities --> young people
1. 起点（题目已经切好了）
   1. entertainers
   2. athletes
2. 终点：
   1. important to students
      1. entertainer: teach students about fashions
      2. athletes: persistence
   2. important to young adults
      1. entertainer: teach how to get alone with friendship
      2. athletes: value exercises
   3. 其实也可以两个起点分别写对young people的好。就不用在终点切开。

#### 魔鬼题

题目包含从句，逻辑终点比较窄。写作的时候所有思路都要落在逻辑终点上，过程中要从头到尾体现出来。

Do you agree or disagree with the statement: To truely enjoy a vacation(holidy), people should leave their mobile phones at home.

In order to attract good students, many universities should spend a lot of money in social activities.

To improve health, which aspect will you change in life?

1. Kinds of food to eat
2. the amount of exercise
3. the amout of stress

这道题可以试着写the amount of exercise:

More exercise -->

1. physical health
   1. by strengthening muscle
   2. by alleviating eyestrain
2. mental health
   1. by help forgetting worries
   2. by prompting happiness
      1. chemical
      2. communication with friends

### 利弊/现象题的写法不同

#### 反面对比

题目的key words均匀分散在文章中，特别是**自己的选项要不断出现**

##### 如何找题目关键词？

**删除法**：删了之后对于句子影响很大，就是关键词。

> Compared with people who live in **cities**, people who live in **rural areas** can **take better care of families**.

> If your teacher says something **incorrect** in a class, what will you do?
>
> **Interrupt** your teacher **right away**
>
> **keep silent**
>
> **correct** your teacher **after cls**.

还有自己的关键选项一定要反复出现：cities / clean env / after cls

#### 如何对比？

AB题：认为A重要，对比B

ABC题：认为A重要，第一个理由段对比B，第二个理由段对比C

A题：

* 认为A重要，对比-A

* 认为BC重要，对比A

##### 例子

AB：大城市能更好照顾家庭，相反，农村没办法更好照顾

现在年轻人花时间更多改善世界：环境多科技多//相反，过去人们不关心这些事

ABC：课后改正老师不好//立刻打断没什么什么好处//保持沉默也没有什么什么好处

A：相反，如果政府**不**改善环境，就没有这些好处

### 其他特殊

现象题里面比较多。论证这个点存在与否。不能说due to the contributions to，而要说due to原因//including小点

Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that ...,
* due to xxxx原因
* including xxxx小点
  * disregarding teacher's opinion
  * disregarding knowledges that the teacher teaches

#### 例子

> Nowadays young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.
>
> 两种写法：
>
> 1. <u>Contrary to these people's opinions is my perspective that modern young people spend less time on improving the world, due to</u> less time and incapability.
>2. <u>Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that modern young people spend more time on improving the world,</u> including the field of environment and technology.

现象题的总结也不能说只有xxx才能xxx，而要写：

> <u>To conclude, only by considering those mentioned above can we draw the conclusion that</u> young people spend more time on improving the world than in the past.

TPO40 综合写作

明天再改。。

The regulation for handling and storing coal ash is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the reading passage, the author proposes three reasons why the regulation is unnecessary. The professor, however, claimed that the new regulation is absolutely necessary.

First, the writer says that the relevant regulations already exist, which force companies to use liner to store their coal ash components. As opposed to this idea, the professor states that these regulations only apply on new built power plants, and there are still many old power plants causing significant damages like contaminating underground water and soil.

Second, the writer suggests that strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discouraging the recycling of coal ash by making consumers concerned that they are dangerous. The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion by examining the fact that mercury is handled and processed under very strict rules but it only raise limited concerns about its savety, and thus concludes that the strict rules for handling not necessarily lead to a discourage for its use.

Third, the writer argues that strict new regulations would increase the costs for power companies. The professor contends that it'll only increase 1% of the public's house electrical bill, which is not a big deal.
