The regulation for handling and storing coal ash is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the reading passage, the author proposes three reasons why the regulation is unnecessary. The professor, however, claimed that the new regulation is absolutely necessary.

First, the writer says that the relevant regulations already exist, which force companies to use liner to store their coal ash components. As opposed to this idea, the professor states that these regulations only apply on new built power plants, and there are still many old power plants causing significant damages like contaminating underground water and soil.

Second, the writer suggests that strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discouraging the recycling of coal ash by making consumers concerned that they are dangerous. The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion by examining the fact that mercury is handled and processed under very strict rules but it only raise limited concerns about its savety, and thus concludes that the strict rules for handling not necessarily lead to a discourage for its use.

Third, the writer argues that strict new regulations would increase the costs for power companies. The professor contends that it'll only increase 1% of the public's house electrical bill, which is not a big deal.

Diet, the foundation of life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over whether family should have regular meals together. Eating at home, in some people's views, is far from important. Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that having family dinner has a great significance, due to the contributions to people's health and relationship.

What must be prioritized is that having dinner at home, instead of eating out alone, is beneficial to our health both physically and mentally. Firstly, never can we ignore the fact that eating at home ensures a healthy body. In detail, people at home can be served with fresh vegetables and clean-washed foods in the first place we buy them, so that our bodies are able to absorb food's full nutrition completely, which is good for our body health; when eating out, on the contrary, it's not likely that we could have the same clean, fresh and nutritious food as we eat at home. Moreover, it's family dinner that provides 【明天接着写。。】
