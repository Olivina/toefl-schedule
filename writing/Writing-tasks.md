The regulation for handling and storing coal ash is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the reading passage, the author proposes three reasons why the regulation is unnecessary. The professor, however, claimed that the new regulation is absolutely necessary.

First, the writer says that the relevant regulations already exist, which force companies to use liner to store their coal ash components. As opposed to this idea, the professor states that these regulations only apply on new built power plants, and there are still many old power plants causing significant damages like contaminating underground water and soil.

Second, the writer suggests that strict rules for storing and handling coal ash might discouraging the recycling of coal ash by making consumers concerned that they are dangerous. The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion by examining the fact that mercury is handled and processed under very strict rules but it only raise limited concerns about its savety, and thus concludes that the strict rules for handling not necessarily lead to a discourage for its use.

Third, the writer argues that strict new regulations would increase the costs for power companies. The professor contends that it'll only increase 1% of the public's house electrical bill, which is not a big deal.

完成作文 1(不计时)，按照给定的行文结构完成翻译，熟悉老师所讲的结构。
Nowadays it is important for people to have regular family meals together.
现在很重要
1.对于健康好 
	a.身体健康，家里吃的食物干净 
	b.精神健康，家里人能聊天，忘记烦恼 
2.对于人际关系好 
	a.互相交换信息，了解彼此工作生活情况 
	b.互相帮助，提出解决问题的方法
	
	开头段:(引入)饮食，是人们生存的基础，越来越受到关注，甚至引发了现在和家人一起用餐是否重要的讨论。(对方观点)在家里吃饭，在一些人看来，不重要。(自己观点)相反我认为在家里吃饭很重要，因为这对人的健康和对人际关系好。
	
	理由段 1:(总论点)首先需要说的是，和家人一起用餐，相比自己单独外面吃饭，对健康好，包括身体健康和精神健康。(分论点 1)首先，我们不能忽视的是，在家吃饭对身体健康好。(解释 1)具体来说，在家里，人们可以吃到第一时间购买的新鲜蔬菜、清洗的很干净的食物，以及吸收全面的营养，对身体健康好；相反，这样新鲜、干净、营养均衡的食物在外面的菜馆是吃不到的。(分论点 2)此外，正是在家用餐对人们的精神健康好。(解释 2)具体来说，在家用餐时，能与家人一起回忆在孩子童年、一同出去旅游或者父母结婚时，开心的事情，这让人们忘记工作和生活中的烦恼，对人们的精神健康好；难道这样快乐的事情会被一个单独在外面吃饭的人回想起来吗?
	理由段 2:(总论点)同样值得讨论的是和家人一起用餐，相比自己单独在外面吃饭，对人际关系好，通过互相交换信息以及互相提出帮助。(分论点 1)首先，正是和家人一起用餐可以和家人交流信息。(解释 1) 具体来说，在家用餐时，人们会互相交换信息，包括近期的身体状态、孩子在学校的表现以及大人工作晋升的情况，拉进彼此的距离；相反，这些在工作和生活中的信息是不能被交换的，如果一个人只是在外面单独吃饭。(分论点 2)此外，正是在家和家人一起用餐可以互相帮助解决困难，增进彼此关系。(解释 2) 具体来说，在家用餐时，人们可以把自己遇到的困难拿出来进行讨论，家人们会提出多个解决方案，在众多的解决方案中可以选择一个最有效的来解决问题; 相反，这样有效的解决问题的方法是不能被得到的，如果自己单独在外面吃饭。
	结尾段:(总结第 1 个理由段)健康，是人们工作和生活的基础，可以通过在家和家人一起用餐来获得。(总结第 2 个理由段)人际关系，是人们发展的必要条件，可以通过在家和家人一起用餐来增进。(总结全文)因此，只有在家和家人一起用餐才能使人们最大化受益。
注:不要让汉语局限了你的思维，语言表达符合英语的要求，而不是单纯的翻译。

Diet, the foundation of life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over whether family should have regular meals together. Eating at home, in some people's views, is far from important. Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that having family dinner has a great significance, due to the contributions to people's health and relationship.

<u>What must be prioritized is that</u> having dinner at home, instead of eating out alone, is beneficial to our health both physically and mentally. <u>Firstly,</u> never can we ignore the fact that eating at home ensures a healthy body. <u>In detail</u>, people at home can be served with fresh vegetables and clean-washed foods in the first place we buy them, so that our bodies are able to absorb food's full nutrition completely, which is good for our body health; when eating out, <u>on the contrary</u>, it's not likely that we could have the same clean, fresh and nutritious food as we eat at home. <u>Moreover</u>, it's family dinner that provides a lovely envrionment for mental health. <u>To explain it further</u>, by gathering together at a family table, family members are able to recall happy memories back in childhood, past traveling and parent's marriage, which can help them temporarily forget about the unhappy trivialities in work and in real life; <u>on the other hand</u>, will a lonely person recall these happy recollections when he eat out alone?

<u>What should be equally discussed is that</u> having dinner with family, rather than eating oneself, can promote relationships, by sharing information and helping with each other. To begin with, it is family dinner that provides us opportunities to communicate with family members. <u>Specifically</u>, when eating home, people change recent information, including their physical health, children's performance at school and adults' promotion at work, which can tie members even closer; <u>on the contrary</u>, under no circumstance will they share these news and information outside the family table when eating along. <u>Additionally</u>, when having a family dinner, members are able to pop their difficulties for discussion, the more solutions the family come up with together, the more effective one he will get for the problem; <u>however</u>, it's not likely that this efficient solving process will happen if someone eats alone.

Health, the basis of a person's life and career, can be boosted by having family dinner. Interpersonal relationship, essential contributor to a person's future development, can be cultivated through dinner with family. To conclude, only by having dinner with family, instead of eating alone, can we maximize our benifits.

> In order to adapt to the life in university and succeed, if you are a freshman, which method do you think is better:

### Note

<<我写的内容

\>>老师写的内容

### 开头

---

<<Campus life, the starting point of a people's life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over <u>what to do to</u> adapt to the university life and succeed.

老师的建议是教育education。。。是作为什么的基础？可以说`personal development/future success`

\>><u>Education, the foundation of future success</u>, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over **<u>how to</u>** adapt to university life and perform outstandingly.

> 遇到应该怎么做的时候（rather than A/D），可以说discussion over how to xxxx

---

<<Attending a short-period introduction program, in some people's views, is the best way to adapt to the campus life.

但是这里其实直接套`attending`并不是很相关，建议可以在`how to`和前文的目的上面多说两句：

\>>==In order to better fit in the life at college==, students, in some people's view, should attend a short-period orientation. 

---

<<Contrary to these people's view is my perspective that students should meet their seniors regularly in their first year, due to the contributions to academic learning and extracurricular life.

`contributions to`后面要接的是受益主语的受益内容

\>>Contrary to these people's view is my perspective that having regular meetings with senior students in the same major ==will benefit freshman, due to the contributions to their== academic and extracurricular life.

`life`很少用`lifes`的用法，复数指几条人命。

---

### 中间段

<<What should be prioritized is that (**meeting --> academic learning**) regularily meeting senior students, instead of attending a short-time orientation, is beneficial for their academic learning, by teaching them effective learning methods and passing them useful study materials.

\>>What must be prioritized is that communicating with senior students, compared with attending an introductory program, ==will place students as beneficiaries in their learning==, ~~including~~ (前面有总才能用including分) by xxxx

`by`有一个逻辑主语，例如`I acquire xxx by my hand`，`by`的逻辑主语和前面的主语应当一致；这句话里前面的主语是`communicating`，那就不能说`by learning methods`，而要说`by helping them acquire new learning methods`:

\>> ... will place students as benerificiaries in their <span style=color:blue>academic learning</span>, by helping them / enabling them to **acquire new learning methods** and **study materials**. 

---

<<To begin with, (meeting --> learning methods) during the regular meetings, senior students are willing to passing their ~~experiences~~(也不要用experience，因为前文没提到),  effective **learning methods** to freshmen.

learning methods已经能够和上一句相关了。
